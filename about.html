            <P>
               In FACT… <br> 
               
              <p> gin gets its name from the Dutch word for juniper, which is genever. If you only remember one thing from today, it’s to send me money. If you remember two things, go ahead and make it that fun fact. For indeed it is juniper, that humble conifer, that tree of twisted trunk and gnarled bough, that sets gin apart from all other types of liquor, for indeed it is juniper that officially must be the prevailing aroma and flavor for a liquor to be classified as gin.

                Gin likely traces its origins to liquors produced back in the Middle Ages, with references to a spirit flavored with “genever” referenced in a 13th Century Flemish manuscript. By the 1600s, the Dutch were producing gin in earnest, with hundreds of distilleries in the city of Amsterdam alone.
                        
              </P>  Gin, like so many things (Coca-Cola and heroin come to mind), was originally produced as a medicine. It was distributed by “chemists” for the treatment of ailments such as gout and dyspepsia. Consumed in large enough quantities, it likely did help ameliorate perception of the symptoms associated these issues and many others, such as “Coward’s Fist,” though only for a few hours at a time. Gin gained in popularity doing the Thirty Years’ War, when British soldiers fighting on Dutch land were bolstered with “Dutch Courage” by, y’know, drinking gin.
